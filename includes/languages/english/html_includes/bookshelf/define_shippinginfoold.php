            <p>*These prices reflect oversized shipping costs due to the size of the gift basket.</p>
            <p>We know that some gift basket companies offer free shipping. If a basket company claims to have free shipping, they are most likely putting that shipping cost into the basket. When you order a $50.00 gift basket from us, you are getting a $50.00 gift basket. That is our guarantee.</p>
            <p><strong>TO GET IT THERE FASTER:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>We offer the following shipping choices:</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>UPS NEXT DAY AIR<br />
            UPS 2ND DAY AIR<br />
            UPS 3RD DAY SELECT<br />
            and<br />
            US POSTAL SERVICE</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>All gift baskets shipped UPS NEXT DAY, 2ND and 3RD DAY AIR are shipped using a dimensional weight chart. Shipping costs are based upon the size of the box, not the weight.&nbsp; Since gift baskets are not small, this can be costly regardless of what your package actually weighs. Our alternative is to ship your package through U.S. Post Office. Their priority mail transit times are approximately two days throughout the country and they do not use dimensional weight to calculate the postage. <strong>Please call customer service to place your order if you want to use U.S. Postal Service.</strong><br />

                        <p>*These prices reflect oversized shipping costs due to the size of the gift basket.</p>
                        <p>We know that some gift basket companies offer free  shipping. If a basket company claims to have free shipping, they are  most likely putting that shipping cost into the basket. When you order a  $50.00 gift basket from us, you are getting a $50.00 gift basket. That  is our guarantee.</p>
                        <p><strong>TO GET IT THERE FASTER:</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>We offer the following shipping choices:</strong></p>
                        <blockquote>
                        <p>UPS NEXT DAY AIR<br />
                        UPS 2ND DAY AIR<br />

                        <p>All gift baskets shipped UPS NEXT DAY, 2ND and 3RD DAY  AIR are shipped using a dimensional weight chart. Shipping costs are  based upon the size of the box, not the weight.&nbsp; Since gift baskets are  not small, this can be costly regardless of what your package actually  weighs. Our alternative is to ship your package through U.S. Post  Office. Their priority mail transit times are approximately two days  throughout the country and they do not use dimensional weight to  calculate the postage. <strong>Please call customer service to place your order if you want to use U.S. Postal Service.</strong><br />

                        We suggest you send your package to the recipient&rsquo;s home  rather than the hospital. We do not deliver directly to the hospital  room; we must leave the package at a delivery station within the  hospital. Therefore, we cannot control the amount of time it takes your  package to actually get to the patient. It is possible that the patient  will be discharged from the hospital within this time, resulting in a  pick up charge, a re-delivery charge and a delay in getting your package  to the recipient. We know you want your gift to be received quickly,  and by sending it to the home address, you eliminate all the problems  that can occur at the hospital.</p>

                        Please note any important information in the <strong>&quot;SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS&quot;</strong>  box.

            <p><strong><a name="hospitals">DELIVERIES TO HOSPITALS:</a></strong><br />
            We suggest you send your package to the recipient&rsquo;s home rather than the hospital. We do not deliver directly to the hospital room; we must leave the package at a delivery station within the hospital. Therefore, we cannot control the amount of time it takes your package to actually get to the patient. It is possible that the patient will be discharged from the hospital within this time, resulting in a pick up charge, a re-delivery charge and a delay in getting your package to the recipient. We know you want your gift to be received quickly, and by sending it to the home address, you eliminate all the problems that can occur at the hospital.</p>
            <p><strong><a name="holiday">HOLIDAY DELIVERY DATE GUARANTEE:</a></strong><br />

We will make every effort to accommodate your delivery request but due to high order volume, your package will be delivered on or as close to your preferred delivery date.<br />
