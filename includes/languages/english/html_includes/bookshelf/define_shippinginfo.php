			<p><strong><a name="guarantee"></a>GUARANTEE:</strong><br />
			We do our best to insure every gift basket arrives in great condition, but in the event it arrives damaged, please notify us immediately and we will replace the damaged items. If the entire basket arrives completely damaged, please keep everything (damaged basket, box, packaging materials etc.) for USPS inspection. We will send out a replacement basket immediately.</p>

			<p><font size="3"><strong>Your satisfaction is very important to us!</strong></font></p>

			<p><strong><a name="refund-policy"></a>REFUND POLICY:</strong><br />
			Store credit given to the return of non-food items only with 30 days with authorization (less 20% wrapping fee if a gift basket). Please call us to obtain authorization. All merchandise must be returned to us in good condition. Return shipping is the responsibility of the recipient/buyer unless defective products. All food items are final sale unless otherwise arranged or damaged. If damaged, we will replace items immediately. All holiday items are final sale. Delivery/shipping charges are nonrefundable.</p>

			<p><strong><a name="correct-address"></a>DELAY/LOSS OF PACKAGE CAN RESULT FROM INCORRECT AND/OR INCOMPLETE ADDRESSES:</strong><br />
			You are responsible for providing accurate and complete shipping information that includes:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Recipient name</li>
				<li>Company name</li>
				<li>Street number and street name</li>
				<li>Floor, suite, apt #</li>
				<li>City, state zip code</li>
				<li>Telephone #</li>
				<li>Please note any important information in the <strong>&quot;SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS&quot;</strong> box. Ex. &ldquo;Office is closed on Wednesdays&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mr. Smith will be leaving on vacation on Friday&rdquo; etc. This will help us expedite you package to the appropriate delivery day.</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong><a name="hospitals">DELIVERIES TO HOSPITALS:</a></strong><br />
			We suggest you send your package to the recipient&rsquo;s home rather than the hospital. We do not deliver directly to the hospital room; we must leave the package at a delivery station within the hospital. Therefore, we cannot control the amount of time it takes your package to actually get to the patient. It is possible that the patient will be discharged from the hospital within this time, resulting in a pick up charge, a re-delivery charge and a delay in getting your package to the recipient. We know you want your gift to be received quickly, and by sending it to the home address, you eliminate all the problems that can occur at the hospital<strong>s.</strong></p>

			<p><strong><a name="perishables"></a>DELIVERING/SHIPPING CHOCOLATE AND FRESH CHEESES:</strong><br />
			Depending on weather and shipping destination, we may need to substitute chocolates &amp; fresh cheeses with other comparable items, equal in quality, to assure your gift baskets arrives in great condition.</p>

			<p><strong>DELIVERING/SHIPPING FRUIT BASKETS:</strong><br />
			We do not SHIP fruit baskets due to their perishable nature. They are available for <strong><a href="http://anythinginabasket.com/cart/admin/index.php?main_page=shippinginfo#hand">*hand delivery</a></strong> (see list below) only. Because we custom design all of our fruit baskets and only use the freshest fruit available, delivery may be delayed by one business day. If your destination address falls under the <strong>*<a href="http://anythinginabasket.com/cart/admin/index.php?main_page=shippinginfo#sameday">hand delivery</a></strong>&rdquo; area, your fruit basket will be delivered the next day. We are very sorry for the inconvenience this may cause, but we feel that delivering the freshest fruit possible is worth the extra day. We never stock fruit, so we are never trying to get rid of old fruit. That is our guarantee.</p>

			<p><strong><a name="sales-tax">SALES TAX COLLECTION:</a></strong><br />
			Sales tax will only be collected if your package is delivered or shipped in New York. You enjoy tax free shopping on all orders being shipped outside of New York. A lot of the bigger gift basket companies cannot offer this because they have locations throughout the country.</p>

			<p><strong>All gift baskets shipped USPS Priority or Standard Post from Huntington, New York (central Long Island)</strong></p>

			We know that some gift basket companies offer free shipping. If a basket company claims to have free shipping, they are most likely putting that shipping cost into the basket. When you order a $50.00 gift basket from us, you are getting a $50.00 gift basket. That is our guarantee.</p>
